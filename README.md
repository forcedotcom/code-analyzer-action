The `run-code-analyzer` GitHub Action scans your code for violations using 
[Salesforce Code Analyzer](https://forcedotcom.github.io/sfdx-scanner), uploads the results as an artifact, and displays
the results as a job summary.

# Inputs
* `run-command` (Default value: `'run'`)
  * <b>Specifies the Salesforce Code Analyzer command to run.</b><br/>
    Possible values are: `'run'`, `'run dfa'`.<br/>
  * For more info on Code Analyzer, read our [documentation](https://forcedotcom.github.io/sfdx-scanner).
* `run-arguments` (Default value: `'--normalize-severity'`)
  * <b>Specifies arguments passed to the specified `run-command` value.</b><br/>
    The arguments provided must include `--normalize-severity`.<br/>
    To control the output file included in the uploaded artifact, specify an output file name with the `--outfile` argument.<br/>
    If an output file isnâ€™t specified, results are written to GitHub workflow run logs and a
    *SalesforceCodeAnalyzerResults.json* file is included in the uploaded artifact.
  * For a full list of acceptable arguments, read the appropriate Command Reference:
    * [sf scanner run](https://forcedotcom.github.io/sfdx-scanner/en/v3.x/scanner-commands/run)
    * [sf scanner run dfa](https://forcedotcom.github.io/sfdx-scanner/en/v3.x/scanner-commands/dfa)
* `results-artifact-name` (Default: `'code-analyzer-results'`)
  * <b>Specifies the name of the zip archive job artifact where the results output file is uploaded.</b>

# Outputs
* `exit-code`
  * The Salesforce Code Analyzer execution exit code.
* `num-violations`
  * The total number of violations found.
* `num-sev1-violations`
  * The number of normalized high-severity violations found.
* `num-sev2-violations`
  * The number of normalized medium-severity violations found.
* `num-sev3-violations`
  * The number of normalized low-severity violations found.

This `run-code-analyzer` action will not exit your GitHub workflow when violations are found. Instead, we recommend adding a subsequent step to your workflow that uses these outputs to determine how your workflow should proceed.
